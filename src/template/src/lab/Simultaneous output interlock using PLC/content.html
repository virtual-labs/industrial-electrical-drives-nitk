<u>INTRODUCTION TO LOGIC</u></b>
</center>
</font>
<p>
A   hardwired   control   circuit   can   be   represented   by   conventional hardwired relay ladder diagram. In any hardwired circuit, there should be electrical continuity in order for the load to energize.</p>

<font size="4"><b><u>Basics about conventional ladder and PLC ladder logic</u></b></font>
<p>Electrical sequence of operation in hardwired relay circuits can be represented by electrical ladder diagram. Ladder diagram shows the interconnection of field devices. In the ladder diagram, each rung shows how a field device is turned on and also shows how it interacts with next field devices.<br><br>
The difference between a PLC ladder program and relay ladder rungs is the  continuity.  In  an  electrical  rung  diagram,  there  is  an  electrical continuity only when the current flows from left power rail to right power rail.</p>

<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/a.jpg" height=120 width=400></img></center>
<br>
<p>Fig (a), shows electrical continuity when SW 1 is closed, as the current flows from L-1 to L-2 energizing the load.<br><br>
Even though PLC ladder logic was modeled after the conventional relay ladder, there is no electrical continuity in PLC ladder logic. PLC ladder rungs should have logical continuity in order for the output to energize. PLC ladder program uses familiar terms like "rungs" and "normally open" and	"normally  closed"  contacts,  but  the  relay  ladder  logic  has  no electrical continuity between an input and the controlled output.<br><br>

<b>Note</b>:- There  is  no  physical  conductor  that  carries  the  input  signal through to the output.<br><br>
Each rung in a ladder diagram is a program statement. This program statement consists of a condition or sometimes conditions, along with some type of action. Inputs are the conditions, and the action, or output, is the result of the conditions.<br><br>

As in case of physical wiring hardware devices connected in series or parallel, PLC also combines ladder program instructions in series or parallel. However, rather than working in series or parallel, the PLC
combines instructions logically using logic operators. Logical operations performed by PLC are nothing but fundamental logic operation, using fundamental logic operators like: AND, OR, and NOT. These operators are used to combine the instructions on a PLC rung so as to make the outcome of each rung either true or false.
</p>

<font size="4"><b><u>The AND-logic function</u></b></font><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/b.jpg" height=200 width=400></img></center>
<p> The series circuit of 2 switches can be looked as an AND logic function. In fig (b) and fig (c), both switch1 and switch2, must be closed to have electrical continuity. W hen  there is  electrical continuity, output  (light1) will energize. Hence the keyword here is AND.<br>

<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/c.jpg" height=200 width=400></img></center>

<p>The circuit in fig (b) is represented as a schematic diagram ladder rung in fig (c).<br><br>

When the switch1 and switch2 is closed, electrical continuity is established to L-2. This is shown in fig (d).</p>

<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/d.jpg" height=200 width=400></img></center>
<br>The various possible switch combinations are shown in the truth table below.<br><br>

Table 1: Truth table for AND logic<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/e.jpg" height=250 width=400></img></center>
<br>Fig (d) can be written in PLC ladder format as shown in the figure below<br>

<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/f.jpg" height=200 width=400></img></center>
<br>
Here is the program listing for a typical PLC, if you are entering the program with a handheld programmer.<br><br>
LOAD I1<br>
AND I2<br>
OUT O5

<p>The above instruction tell the processor to load input 1 (I1) into memory, AND it with input 2 (I2) and then output the result to output 5 (O5). The resulting output will be based on the truth table fig (e).</p>

<font size="4"><b><u>The OR-logic function</u></b></font><br>
<p>In an OR - LOGIC function, the output is true if any input is true. The OR logic also states that if all inputs are true, the output will be true.<br>

<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/g.jpg" height=250 width=400></img></center>
<br>

<p>In the above figure, if switch1 OR switch2 is energized then light1 will energize. Also, if both SW 1 and SW2 are true, the output will also be true.<br><br>
Fig (g) is converted to PLC ladder rung and it looks like fig (h)<br>

<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/h.jpg" height=250 width=400></img></center>

<p>A PLC rung of logic will have normally open or normally closed contacts instead of normally open or normally closed switch symbols. Addresses and instructions are included. Here, in additions to each contact and its address, text information such as SW1, SW2 and L-1 is used and they are  referred  to  as  instruction comments.  These  instruction comments can be added from programming software.</p>
Table 2: Truth table representing two-input OR function<br>

<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/i.jpg" height=250 width=400></img></center><br><br>

<font size="4"><b><u>The NOT-logic function</u></b></font>
<p>A normally closed relay contact passes power any time when the relay coil  is  not  energized. In  the  same manner, the  normally closed PLC ladder logic instruction will pass power any time when the input status file bit associated is  not a  1. In this condition, the physical hardware input is not sending an input signal into the PLC's input module. The opposite of normally open PLC instruction or contact is the NOT logic. NOT logic can be used in conjunction with AND or OR logic, when a logical 0 in the status file is expected to activate some output device. In other words, NOT logic is used when an input is not energized i.e., 0 in the associated status bit, the output should be energized. Also, when the input is energized i.e., 1 in the associated status bit, the output should not be energized.</p>

<br>

<font size="4"><u>Analysis of rung 1</u></font>
<p>When I1 is true i.e. the input status file bit regarding I1 is true (1), the instruction I1 will energize the output. The instruction I1 is considered true when it passes logical continuity. If there is no valid input signal from the field input devices attached to I1's screw terminal on the input module, a logical 0 will be placed in the associated input status file bit. A logical 0 in the input status file will make the normally open input instruction to become false .When normally open instruction is false, it will not pass logical continuity.</p>

<font size="4"><u>Analysis of rung 2</u></font>
<p>The normally closed instruction works	much like normally closed contacts on a hardware relay. In the fig (k), when the normally closed instruction I2 is true, i.e. the associated status file bit has a valid zero (0), logical	continuity  is established to energize the output. When the associated status file bit has valid 1, the NC instruction goes false and there is no logical continuity and the output is not energized.</p>

<font size="4"><b><u>The PARALLEL NOT- logic function</u></b></font>

<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/l.jpg" height=200 width=400></img></center>
<br>
PLC ladder rung has 2 input instructions, one normally open and the other one is normally closed. This circuit contains parallel NOT logic. This schematic rung will be true under the conditions shown in the truth table below.<br><br>

Ladder rung of EXOR GATE would look like this<br>

<center>
<img src="../images/LADDER/p.jpg" height=250 width=400></img></center>
<br>

<u><b>Case 1</b></u>
<p>When I1 = 0 and I2 = 0:<br><br>
Let us analyze main rung. When I1 = 0, the normally open instruction is false and, normally closed instruction is true, but since normally open instruction is false, there is no logical continuity and output cannot be energized. Similar analysis can be done in parallel rung, normally closed instruction will be true and normally open instruction will be false and output is not energized.</p>

<u><b>Case 2</b></u>
<p>When I1= 0 and I2 = 1:<br><br>
In main rung, normally open instruction will be false and, normally closed instruction will be true, but since there is no logical continuity this rung logic cannot energize the output. But, in parallel rung, normally closed instruction will be true, as well as normally open instruction will also be true, hence there is logical continuity, and output is energized.</p>

<u><b>Case 3</b></u>
<p>When I1 = 1 and I2 = 0:<br><br>
This case is similar to case 2, only the role of inputs are interchanged i.e. here main rung is true and energizes the output and parallel rung is false.</p>

<u><b>Case 4</b></u>
<p>When both inputs are true, the main ladder rung as well as the parallel ladder rung goes false. In main rung, normally open instruction is true but normally closed instruction is false. Hence, there is no logical continuity.    In parallel ladder rung, normally closed instruction is false and normally open instruction is true, and here also there is no logical continuity. Hence, the output is not energized.</p>

<center><font size="5"><u><b>Aim of the experiment: Simultaneous output interlock using PLC</b></u></font>
<br></center>

<font size="4"><u><b>Theory</u> : </b></font><br>
<p>In many applications, there are certain processes which cannot happen simultaneously. In our experiment, out of three motors, only one can be running at a time. Even if the operator tries to energize more than one motor at a time, the PLC should make sure that only one is energized. Even in other manufacturing process, either due to a bug in program or due to mistake of operator, the PLC might receive all three inputs simultaneously, so such an interlock is a necessary safety precaution to prevent damage.</p>

<p><font size="4"><u><b>Aim</u> : </b></font>
Simultaneous output interlock of motors using PLC.
</p>

<p><font size="4"><u><b>Procedure</u> : </b></font>In our experiment, there are 3 motors which can be turned ON  or OFF via PLC. But we wish to have a simultaneous output interlock. That is, only one motor can be running at a time. If the operator wants to start another motor, then he has to stop the motor which is currently running. Then only he can turn on another motor.
<br>
 Let us see the basic diagram of the circuitry.
</p>

<center>
<img src="../images/outputinterlock/PR/1.jpg" height=500 width=500></img><br></center>

<b><font size="4"><u>Ladder Logic design:</u></font></b>
<p>Now, let us see how the ladder logic of simultaneous output interlock of 3 motor is implemented using PLC.</p>


Our assumption:
<ul type=disc>
<li>All the three motors have their own START and STOP push buttons. Both START and STOP push buttons are of normally open types.</li><br>

<li>Since inputs and outputs are less, 8-point I/O module is sufficient, where CPU resides in slot 0, input module resides in slot 1 and output module resides in slot 2.</li><br>
<li>Let us assign address for the input and output signals of the PLC.<br><br>

<ul type=square>
<li>START1(Normally open push button) = I : 1/0</li><br>
<li>START2(Normally open push button) = I : 1/1</li><br>
<li>START3(Normally open push button) = I : 1/2</li><br>
<li>STOP1(Normally open push button) = I : 1/3</li><br>
<li>STOP2(Normally open push button) = I : 1/4</li><br>
<li>STOP3(Normally open push button) = I : 1/5</li><br>
<li>MOTOR1 = O:2/0</li><br>
<li>MOTOR2 = O:2/1</li><br>
<li>MOTOR3 = O:2/2</li><br>
<li>MTR 1  LED= O:2/3</li><br>
<li>MTR 2  LED= O:2/4</li><br>
<li>MTR 3  LED= O:2/5</li><br>
</ul>
</li>


<li>Let us see its ladder logic<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/outputinterlock/PR/2.jpg" height=500 width=600></img><br></center>
<br>The above ladder program has 3 rungs, let us see the function of each rung individually.
</li>
</ul>


<font size="4"><u><b>Rung 000:</b></u></font><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/outputinterlock/PR/3.jpg" height=250 width=600></img></center>

<p>The above rung is used to energize MOTOR1. In this rung, logical continuity is passed only when MOTOR2, MOTOR3 are in de-energized state. The logical continuity is lost whenever the STOP1 push button is pressed. If MOTOR2 and MOTOR3  are in de-energized is seen using MTR1LED, which is connected in parallel with MOTOR1.So if we want to energize MOTOR2 or MOTOR3, then MOTOR1 has to be stopped and then only MOTOR2 or MOTOR3 has to be started(only one can be started).</p>


<font size="4"><u><b>Rung 001:</b></u></font><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/outputinterlock/PR/4.jpg" height=250 width=600></img></center>
<p>The above rung is used to energize MOTOR2. In this rung, logical continuity is passed only when MOTOR1, MOTOR3 are in de-energized state. The logical continuity is lost whenever the STOP2 push button is pressed. If MOTOR1 and MOTOR3  are in de-energized is seen using MTR2LED, which is connected in parallel with MOTOR2.So if we want to energize MOTOR1 or MOTOR3, then MOTOR2 has to be stopped and then only MOTOR1 or MOTOR3 has to be started(only one can be started).</p>


<font size="4"><u><b>Rung 002:</b></u></font><br>
<center>
<img src="../images/outputinterlock/PR/5.jpg" height=250 width=600></img></center>
<p>The above rung is used to energize MOTOR3. In this rung, logical continuity is passed only when MOTOR2, MOTOR1 are in de-energized state. The logical continuity is lost whenever the STOP3 push button is pressed. If MOTOR2 and MOTOR1  are in de-energized is seen using MTR3LED, which is connected in parallel with MOTOR3.So if we want to energize MOTOR2 or MOTOR1, then MOTOR3 has to be stopped and then only MOTOR2 or MOTOR1 has to be started(only one can be started).</p>


The following screen shot represents the operation:
<br>
<center>
<img src="../images/outputinterlock/PR/6.jpg" height=550 width=800></img></center>
<br>The above screen shot represents the condition where MOTOR1 is running, and on the pressing of START2 button does not energize MOTOR2, thus achieving Simultaneous output interlock using PLC.
